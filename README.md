### 💡 Project Overview --->

**ARACHN3T** is the open-source component of the SPECTRAL platform, designed to eliminate manual oversight and mitigate risk through advanced, autonomous system analysis. By implementing **Ternary Architecture** and leveraging **Intuitive Assistive AI (IAAI)**, this framework provides security teams with deep, real-time insights into server operations, allowing them to move past alert fatigue and focus on high-value threat intelligence relative to DNS / Javascript / Database currently.

This project is specifically focused on defensive cybersecurity, operational integrity, and ensuring high-fidelity data logging.

Based on your country, ARACHN3T increases your odds of a successful bounty submission by 75%.
If a vulnerability is discovered in ethicality for Bug Bounty --> YOU ARE WELCOME.

## Database
Click the Hub in center to cycle 350K+ domains across the web monitored by ARACHN3T!
We do not own these domains and understand the critical job we have of disclosing anything we find regarding them ethically.

## Vector Scan
**WARNING** 
HIT OR MISS OPERATION given security of submitted entity.

### It is a scan that succeeds or fails and then pivots to **MYA** where you can submit a Work Request directly.
### Root domain or Subdomain URL entry suggested. ( URI path feature in dev )
### Examples: 
http(s):/rainaiinc.com 
or 
http(s):example.rainaiinc.com <---- Anything after extension is deemed URI.
