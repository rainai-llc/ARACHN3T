### 💡 Project Overview

**ARACHN3T** is the open-source component of the SPECTRAL platform, designed to eliminate manual oversight and mitigate risk through advanced, autonomous system analysis. By implementing **Ternary Architecture** and leveraging **Intuitive Assistive AI (IAAI)**, this framework provides security teams with deep, real-time insights into system operations, allowing them to move past alert fatigue and focus on high-value threat intelligence.

This project is specifically focused on defensive cybersecurity, operational integrity, and ensuring high-fidelity data logging.
